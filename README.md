## 🔥 What is the War Room?

The War Room is a high-accuracy competitor analysis engine that turns any store URL into a complete intelligence brief. It extracts:

- **Estimated Ad Spend**  
- **Traffic Composition** (social / organic / paid / referral)  
- **Creative Intelligence** (hooks, angles, counter-hooks)  
- **Competitor Threat Radar** (direct rivals in the niche)  
- **Recent Activity Feed** (new ads, viral posts, price changes)  
- **Brand Visual DNA** (colour palette, design patterns)  
- **Social Profiles** (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube)  
- **Tactical Attack Plan** (step-by-step strategy to outperform them)

This repository contains **only** the War Room feature — clean, fast and production-ready.
